# Brain Tumor Segmentation

This project uses deep learning (U-Net) to segment brain tumors from MRI images using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.

## ðŸ§  Features
- Preprocessing MRI images and masks
- U-Net-based segmentation model
- Trains and saves the best model
- Visualizes original image, ground truth, and predicted mask
